# SortBot
This project aims to complete the objectives spelled out by the [Thoughtful Technical Screen](https://thoughtfulautomation.notion.site/Technical-Screen-b61b6f6980714c198dc49b91dd23d695).

## Getting started

### Running
```
npm install
npm build
npx serve ./dist
```

### Tests
```
npm run test
```

## Technical Screen Objective Details

### Objective

Imagine you work in Thoughtful’s robotic automation factory, and your objective is to write a function for one of its robotic arms that will dispatch the packages to the correct stack according to their volume and mass.

### Rules

Sort the packages using the following criteria:

- A package is **bulky** if its volume (Width x Height x Length) is greater than or equal to 1,000,000 cm³ or when one of its dimensions is greater or equal to 150 cm.
- A package is **heavy** when its mass is greater or equal to 20 kg.

You must dispatch the packages in the following stacks:

- **STANDARD**: standard packages (those that are not bulky or heavy) can be handled normally.
- **SPECIAL**: packages that are either heavy or bulky can't be handled automatically.
- **REJECTED**: packages that are **both** heavy and bulky are rejected.

### Implementation

Implement the function **`sort(width, height, length, mass)`** (units are centimeters for the dimensions and kilogram for the mass). This function must return a string: the name of the stack where the package should go.

### Submission Guidance

1. **Time Management**: Allocate no more than 30 minutes to complete this challenge. 
2. **Programming Language**: You may use any programming language you're comfortable with. This is an opportunity to showcase your skills in a language you are proficient in.
3. **Submission Format**:
    - **Option 1**: Submit a public GitHub repository with clear README instructions.
    - **Option 2 (Preferred)**: Host your solution on an online IDE like [Repl.it](http://repl.it/) or CodePen for immediate code review. Ensure the link is accessible for direct execution.
4. **Evaluation Criteria**: Submissions will be assessed on:
    - Correct sorting logic.
    - Code quality.
    - Handling edge cases and inputs.
    - Test coverage.

✨ **This workspace has been generated by [Nx, Smart Monorepos · Fast CI.](https://nx.dev)** ✨

## Integrate with editors

Enhance your Nx experience by installing [Nx Console](https://nx.dev/nx-console) for your favorite editor. Nx Console
provides an interactive UI to view your projects, run tasks, generate code, and more! Available for VSCode, IntelliJ and
comes with a LSP for Vim users.

## Build the library

Run `npx nx build` to build the library. The build artifacts are stored in the output directory (i.e. `dist/`), ready to be published.

## Running tasks

To execute tasks with Nx use the following syntax:

```
npx nx <target> <project> <...options>
```

You can also run multiple targets:

```
npx nx run-many -t <target1> <target2>
```

..or add `-p` to filter specific projects

```
npx nx run-many -t <target1> <target2> -p <proj1> <proj2>
```

Targets can be defined in the `package.json` or `projects.json`. Learn more [in the docs](https://nx.dev/features/run-tasks).

## Set up CI!

Nx comes with local caching already built-in (check your `nx.json`). On CI you might want to go a step further.

- [Set up remote caching](https://nx.dev/features/share-your-cache)
- [Set up task distribution across multiple machines](https://nx.dev/nx-cloud/features/distribute-task-execution)
- [Learn more how to setup CI](https://nx.dev/recipes/ci)

## Explore the project graph

Run `npx nx graph` to show the graph of the workspace.
It will show tasks that you can run with Nx.
